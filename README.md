# HealthHub

HealthHub is a web application that allows patients to book appointments, manage their patient records, receive remote consultations, manage their prescriptions, receive patient reminders, provide feedback, and monitor their health through a connected device. The backend is built using Node.js and Mongoose, providing a robust and scalable architecture for handling patient data. The frontend is built using React, providing a user-friendly interface for patients to interact with the backend.

## Architecture

The backend of HealthHub is built using Node.js and Mongoose. Node.js is a popular runtime environment for building server-side applications, while Mongoose is a powerful object modeling tool for MongoDB. MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database that provides scalability and flexibility for handling large volumes of patient data.

The frontend of HealthHub is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture for building reusable UI components, making it easy to develop a user-friendly and responsive interface.

The backend and frontend communicate with each other through RESTful APIs, providing a decoupled architecture that allows for easy maintenance and scaling.
