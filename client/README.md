# HealthHub Frontend

This is a React app that allows patients to book appointments with doctors, access their medical records, have remote consultations, manage their prescriptions, and provide feedback.

## Features

- Online Booking System: Patients can easily book an appointment with the doctor of their choice and see their available timeslots, which can help them avoid long waiting times at the clinic.
- Patient Records: The app can store patient's details including their medical history, allergies, and medication, so the doctors can have access to all the necessary information in one place.
- Remote Consultation: Doctors can have a virtual meeting with their patients through video conferencing, which can help save time and make it easier for patients who are unable to physically visit the clinic.
- Prescription Management: Doctors can write and send prescription directly to the patient's pharmacy, which can save time and make it easier for patients to get their medications.
- Patient Reminders: The app can send reminders to patients about their upcoming appointments and medication schedules, which can help improve adherence to treatment plans.
- Feedback System: Patients can provide feedback about their experience with the doctor and the app, which can help improve the quality of care and service provided.
